funtions

my_string.upper()
my_string.lower()

.startswith()
.endswith()
.split() ---> creates an list if we dont specify anything it will consider space as a value
.replace()

in is used to check if the value is present or not

''.join() is used to convert collection as a string
if we need space in between we'll use ' '.join()
